Getting and Cleaning Data - Coursera Project

This files reports the steps undertaken to achieve the goals of the project work.

Project Summary
This project was set up to extract mean and standard error values from a dataset which was produced during the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphone Study to obtain a tidy dataset with the help of R. The ‘Project_getting_cleaning_data.R’ script will execute different commands to yield the desired results. 
Script description
1.	Basic set up of workspace, working directory and data acquisition
2.	Reading in the training and test data sets for further analysis
3.	Merging data to obtain one big dataset
4.	Load feature list, extract subset of mean/std that we need and include it in the dataset
5.	Name the activities in the dataset
6.	Get column names with subset from feature list
7.	Use reshape2 to create new tidy data with means and std 
8.	Write tidy data as csv file into directory

Repository Information
This repository contains 3 main files:
‘Project_getting_cleaning_data.R’ - This script perform sthe analysis on the required sample data.
tidy.txt - This is the final output from the run_analysis.R script.  It contains a cleansed version of the sample data.
CodeBook.md - Contains the definitions of each of the columns in our generated tidy.txt file.
